- one sample t-test
	- assumption:
		- sample come from randomization
		- sample approximately normal
	- hypotheses: population mean = mu
	- code: Lecture 7 slide 16
- non-parametric one sample test (Wilcoxon signed rank test)
	- assumption:
		- sample not normal
	- hypotheses: population median = m_0
	- code: Lecture 7 slide 25
- two independent sample test
	- assumption: 
		- independent sample
		- variance of 2 group if not same, use unequal variance compare means test
		- each group population distribution approximately normal
	- hypotheses: population mean 1 mu_1 = population mean 2 mu_2
	- code: Lecture 7 slide 38
- non-parametric two independent sample test (Wilcoxon rank sum test / Mann-Whitney U-test)
	- assumption: 
		- small sample / not normal distributed
	- hypotheses: no difference between two groups
	- code: Lecture 7 slide 52
- two dependent sample parametric test
	- assumption:
		- differences between 2 groups approximately normal
	- hypotheses: means of 2 groups same
	- code: Lecture 7 slide 63
- two dependent sample non-parametric test
	- assumption:
		- small sample / difference not normally distributed
	- hypotheses: no difference between two groups
	- code: Lecture 7 slide 67
- anova
	- assumption:
		- random samples
		- all groups equal variance (use Shapiro test normality, if any group is not normal, use Levene, else use Bartlett)
		- check residual if normally distributed (use Shapiro test / qq plot on residuals)
	- hypotheses: all means are equal
	- code: Lecture 8 slide 26
- kruskal wallis test
	- assumption:
		- non-normal data
		- variances unequal
	- hypotheses: groups have same distribution
	- code: Lecture 8 slide 36
- Bonferroni
	- used in anova / kruskal
	- code: Lecture 8 slide 43
- Tukey
	- used in anova
	- code: Lecture 8 slide 50
- linear regression
	- assumption:
		- relationship of X, Y linear (check with scatter plot)
		- residual constant variance assumption (check with scatter plot with line at 0, check shape and most points within 3)
		- residual normality assumption (check with qq plot / shapiro test)
	- steps:
		- plot X, Y to see if linear
		- fit model first, use model summary to get beta_0 and beta_1
		- use anova to see which coefficient most important
		- get residual from model, convert to standardized residual
		- check residual qq plot to see if normally distributed
		- check residual scatterplot to see if constant variance
		- run predictions
