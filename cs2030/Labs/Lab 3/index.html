<h3>Discrete Event Simulator Version 2</h3>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>OOP Design consideration: continuation with switch-based event dispatching by event type</li>
<li>Program documentation: adherance to <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2030/javadoc/" target="_blank">CS2030 Javadoc</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Problem Description</h4>
<p>Let's make some changes to the queuing system in the previous lab. Specifically,</p>
<ul>
<li>there are now <tt>k ≥ 1</tt> servers, arranged in order from <tt>1</tt> to <tt>k</tt>; </li>
<li>only one waiting customer is allowed per server; </li>
<li>when a customer arrives at the shop: <ol>
<li>he/she scans the servers from <tt>1</tt> to <tt>k</tt>, and approaches the first idle server to be served immediately; </li>
<li>if there is no idle server, the customer scans the servers from <tt>1</tt> to <tt>k</tt>, and waits at the first busy server without any waiting customer; </li>
<li>if every server is busy and already has a waiting customer, he/she leaves the shop. </li>
</ol> </li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of this, you might realize that there is a better way to encapsulate the data and the behavior of the various entities in the program.  In which case, you may want to consider re-organize=ing your solution.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that there are still five states of the system, namely <tt>ARRIVES</tt>,  <tt>SERVED</tt>, <tt>WAITS</tt> <tt>LEAVES</tt> and <tt>DONE</tt>.  and only one of three possible state transitions for each customer:</p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>ARRIVES</tt> → <tt>SERVED</tt> → <tt>DONE</tt> </li>
<li> <tt>ARRIVES</tt> → <tt>WAITS</tt> → <tt>SERVED</tt> → <tt>DONE</tt> </li>
<li> <tt>ARRIVES</tt> → <tt>LEAVES</tt> </li>
</ul>
<p>Statistics of the system that we need to keep track of are:</p>
<ol>
<li>the average waiting time for customers who have been served </li>
<li>the number of customers served </li>
<li>the number of customers who left without being served </li>
</ol>
<h4>The Task</h4>
<p>Input now consists of the following (in order of presentation)</p>
<ul>
<li>number of servers; </li>
<li>set of customer arrival times in chronological order </li>
</ul>
<p>Output comprises the individual discrete events, and also the statistics at the end of the simulation.</p>
<p>Take note of the following assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The maximum number of events is 100 <strong>at any one time</strong>; </li>
<li>The format of the input is always correct; </li>
<li>Output of a <tt>double</tt> value, say <tt>d</tt>, is to be formatted with <tt>String.format("%.3f", d)</tt>; <!--
<li>Inconsistencies between sample output and actual output involving <tt>-0.000</tt> and <tt>0.000</tt> can be ignored. --> </li>
</ul>
<!--
<p>This task is divided into several levels. Read through all the levels  to see how the different levels are related. <b>You may start from any level.</b>
<p>In each level, you are to  -->
<p>As this lab is a continuation form the previous one, this task will be treated as Level 6. Your programs for <tt>sim1</tt> to <tt>sim5</tt> in the previous lab has been made available to you. Just remember to</p>
<ul>
<li>define a <tt>Main</tt> class with the <tt>main</tt> method to handle input and output; </li>
<li>check for output format correctness using the <tt>diff</tt> utility (see specific level for usage details).  Note that only <strong>one</strong> test case is provided for this; </li>
<li>check for styling errors by invoking <tt>checkstyle</tt>. For example, to check styling for all java files
<pre>$ checkstyle *.java
</pre>
</li>
<li>save a copy of all source files into the appropriate level directory (see specific level for usage details). </li>

<h4>Level 6</h4>
<p><big><strong> Discrete event simulation with <tt>k</tt> servers </strong></big></p>
<p>You might want to first include the <tt>k</tt> servers, but only work with the first server, so that the output you get is consistent with the single server simulator.</p>
<p>Thereafter, whenever an event is picked from the queue, process that event by consider all <tt>k</tt> servers and generate the new event.</p>
