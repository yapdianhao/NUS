<h3>Discrete Event Simulator Version 3<br>
&mdash; Randomized Arrival and Service Time</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<ul>
<li>OOP Design: Inheritance-based event dispatch;
<li>Use <tt>PriorityQueue&lt;E&gt;</tt> from the Java Collections Framework to store the events;
<li>Packaging the classes into the package <tt>cs2030.simulator</tt>;
<li>Randomizing the arrival and service times.
</ul>

<h4>Priority Queuing</h4>

<p>The <tt>PriorityQueue</tt> class can be used to keep a collection of elements, where each element is given a certain priority.

<ul>
<li>Elements can be added with the <tt>add(E e)</tt> method;
<li>The <tt>poll()</tt> method can be used to retrieve and remove the element with the highest priority; it returns an object of type <tt>E</tt>, or <tt>null</tt> if the queue is empty.
</ul>


<p>To enable <tt>PriorityQueue&lt;E&gt;</tt> to order events, instantiate a <tt>PriorityQueue&lt;E&gt;</tt> object using the constructor that takes in a <i>Comparator</i> object.
<i>For more details, refer to the Java API Specifications.</i>

<!-- 
If you design is right, you should only change the code in four places: (i) initialize list of events, (ii) schedule an event, (iii) get the next event, (iv) checking if there is still an event.

(Hint: You should be able to implement a Comparator without getter getTime())
-->

<h4>Using Packages</h4>

<p>Recall that Java has a higher-level of abstraction barrier called a package.
So far, you have been creating classes in the default package.
In this lab, you are to create the <tt>cs2030.simulator</tt> package.
A directory <tt>cs2030/simulator</tt> has been created for you in your labs, it contains a <tt>RandomGenerator</tt> class that will be used for the next part.

<p>Specifically, all classes dealing with the simulation should now reside in the <tt>cs2030.simulator</tt> package, with the <tt>Main</tt> class
importing the necessary classes from the package.

<h4>Randomized Arrival and Service Time</h4>

<p>Simulation of different arrival and service times is achieved via the use of random number generation.
A random number generator is an entity that generates one random number after another. 
Since it is not possible to generate a truly random number algorithmically, pseudo random number generation is adopted instead.
A pseudo-random number generator can be initialized with a seed, such that the same seed always produces the same sequence of (seemingly random) numbers.

<p>Although, Java provides a class <tt>java.util.Random</tt>, an alternative <tt>RandomGenerator</tt> class that is more suitable for discrete event simulation is provided for you that encapsulates different random number generators for use in our simulator. 
Each random number generator generates a different stream of random numbers. The constructor for <tt>RandomGenerator</tt> takes in three parameters:

<ul>
<li><tt>int seed</tt> is the base seed.
Each random number generator uses its own seed that is derived from this base seed;
<li><tt>double lambda</tt> is the arrival rate, &lambda;;
<li><tt>double mu</tt> is the service rate, &mu;.
</ul>

<p>The <b>inter-arrival time</b> is usually modeled as an exponential random variable, characterized by a single parameter <tt>&lambda;</tt> denoting the arrival rate. 
<!--
Mathematically, the inter-arrival time can be generated with
âˆ’ln(U)/&lambda;, where U is a random variable between 0 and 1.
-->
The <tt>genInterArrivalTime()</tt> method of the class <tt>RandomGenerator</tt> is used for this purpose.
Specifically,

<ul>
<li>start the simulation by generating the first arrival event with timestamp <tt>0</tt>.
<li>every time an arrival event is processed, it generates another arrival event and schedules it;
<li>if there are still more customers to simulate, generate the next arrival event with a timestamp of <tt>T + now</tt>, where <tt>T</tt> is generated with the method <tt>genInterArrivalTime()</tt>;
</ul>

<p>The <b>service time</b> is modeled as an exponential random variable, characterized by a single parameter, service rate &mu;.
The method <tt>genServiceTime()</tt> from the class <tt>RandomGenerator</tt> can be used to generate the service time.
Specifically,

<ul>
<li>each time a customer is being served, a <tt>DONE</tt> event is generated and scheduled;
<li>the <tt>DONE</tt> event generated will have a timestamp of <tt>T
 + now</tt>, where
<tt>T</tt> is generated with the method <tt>genServiceTime()</tt>.
</ul>

<p>You may refer to the API of the <tt>RandomGenerator</tt> class 
<a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2030/RandomGenerator">here</a>.
<!--
that encapsulates a pseudo-random number generator. We can create a random number generator with a seed:
<pre>
Random rng = new Random(1);
</pre>
We can then call rng.nextDouble() repeatedly to generate random numbers between 0 and 1.
-->

<p>As usual, you will need to keep track of the following statistics:

<ol>
<li>the average waiting time for customers who have been served
<li>the number of customers served
<li>the number of customers who left without being served
</ol>

<h4>The Task</h4>

<p>Input now consists of the following (in order of presentation):

<ul>
<li>the first line is an <tt>int</tt> value denoting the base seed for the <tt>RandomGenerator</tt> object;
<li>the second line is an <tt>int</tt> value representing the number of servers
<li>the third line is an <tt>int</tt> representing the number of customers (or the number of arrival events) to simulate
<li>the fourth line is a <tt>double</tt> parameter for the arrival rate, &lambda;
<li>the last line is a <tt>double</tt> parameter for the service rate, &mu;
</ul>

Output comprises the individual discrete events, and also the statistics at the end of the simulation.

<p>Take note of the following assumptions:
<ul>
<li>The maximum number of customers is 100;
<li>The format of the input is always correct;
<li>Output of a <tt>double</tt> value, say <tt>d</tt>, is to be formatted with <tt>String.format("%.3f", d)</tt>;
<!--
<li>Inconsistencies between sample output and actual output involving <tt>-0.000</tt> and <tt>0.000</tt> can be ignored.
-->
</ul>

<p>This task is divided into several levels.
Read through all the levels 
to see how the different levels are related.

As this lab is a continuation form the previous one, your programs for <tt>sim1</tt> to <tt>sim6</tt> has been made available to you.
Just remember to

<ul>
<li>define a <tt>Main</tt> class with the <tt>main</tt> method to handle input;
<li>check for output format correctness using the <tt>diff</tt> utility (see specific level for usage details).  Note that only <b>one</b> test case is provided for this;
<li>check for styling errors by invoking <tt>checkstyle</tt>. For example, to check styling for all java files
<pre>
$ checkstyle *.java
</pre>
<li>save a copy of all source files into the appropriate level directory (see specific level for usage details).
