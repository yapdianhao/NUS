=== Storage Class Diagram

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::Storage.png[width="700"]

`StorageManager` is the main functional class in the `Storage` component, extending the interfaces `JelphaBotStorage`
and `UserPrefsStorage`. `JsonUserPrefsStorage` can save and read `UserPref` objects in .json format, while `JsonJelphaBotStorage`
can save `JelphaBot` 's data and read them. `Reminder` and `Task` are converted to the json-friendly `JsonAdaptedTask` and
`JsonAdaptedReminder`, then saved by `JsonJelphaBotStorage`. +
This class diagram enables developers to have an overarching view of the `Storage` component and
its interactions with the json files. It is crucial due to certain aspects
such as `JsonAdaptedReminder` are not found in the original `Storage` component.

=== Reminder Class Diagram

`Reminder` is a newly introduced class to the product, and has the same significance of a `Task`.
`ModelManager` manages the adding and removing of a `Reminder` by calling the `addReminder` method of `JelphaBot`, which adds a
`Reminder` into its `UniqueReminderList`. A `UniqueReminderList` can store arbitrary amount of `Reminder`, in which
each `Reminder` has an `Index` of the task that it needs to remind, a `ReminderDay` which refers to the day the `Task`
will be reminded, and a `ReminderHour`. +
This class diagram plays a crucial role in summarizing the `Reminder` object and
its relations with the `Model` component.

=== Reminder Sequence Diagram

This sequence diagram provides a summary of the process from the user enters the command to the storing of the
`Reminder` object. Next, The `Logic` `execute()` method creates a `ReminderCommand` from the input string by parsing the input according to the command word and several other attributes.
Next, the input string is converted into `Index`, `ReminderDay`, `ReminderHour`,
and a `Reminder` object with these properties are forwarded to `Model`. The `Model` first checks the validity of the attributes respectively.
The valid `Reminder` is then added to the `UniqueReminderList`. Lastly, the `Logic` fires the `Storage`
to save the `Reminder`. +

This diagram is the most important diagram for the `Reminder` feature as it provides a complete picture from
front-end to back-end. Since the process is not trivial, several reference frames are required for developers to view
in isolation of components for a clearer picture, and to avoid tiny fonts if all the processes are combined
in a sequence diagram.
